The first thing i see is that the author fails to recognize that this is first time ever that a digital asset has not been hacked. It would be nice if he could acknowledged the greater technology while there are several good points he makes where we may not know how these evolve and are complex.

To me in life a greater technology will manifest itself in some way. It may not be exactly be the way some might see now, or there could be huge pitfalls that can regress crypto in some way but in general greater my belief is that a superior technology will prevail in some way. Just like in the beginning of internet there was lot of hype but eventually we know the power of it. Same thing with Cloud and AI technologies. 

Also just like Taxies were upended by Uber, if there is a secure way that people can directly lend and borrow directly i do not see why there is need for a 3rd party trusted custodial. Because that would cut lot of overhead since Blockchain technologies are just programs. The key word is if its "Secure". And technlogy will mature with time. So to me i do see this as future. There is also lending/Borrowing protocols with AAVE etc. So to me not everyrthing is a scam and banks themselves will get in this to get competitive edge over other banks even in the interim. 

Author says crypto has not solved any problem. But we can transfer bitcoin to anywhere in the world in 10 mins w/o any further reconciliations needed nor all the 3rd parties that normal transfers moves through!! 

Also the author seems to have already delivered verdict that fundamental limitations of scalability of blockchain-based technologies - where as these are being worked out and we are in early stages of development.  

Author talks about controlling some of the money supply. i think Government will still collect taxes even with crypto (we still need to follow the law) and can have CBDC and they will have ways to handle disbursing welfare etc. Like right now in pandemic situation they could send CBDCs as Of course we dont know how it will look but this 





I agree there is lot of wild speculative gambling going on too like Wonderland Time project. And so many more. But i think the scammer and gamblers  are nothing new to any particular technology or new shift coming. People are always trying to hustle to get more money in new ways and some do it ethically and some through scams.

I do agree 100% we need more regulations in crypto. and figure how to limit these type of scams. 



Author also compare to some other type of currencies and also talks about information not privy to common people. While this is a complex topic and my background is not economy or finance but we can say that these are public ledgers so lot more transparent. Even with recent 2008 financial meltdown Lehmann brothers cooked their books but with pucblic ledger blockchains that would not happen is what i read. I still do think there is lot more maturity is needed before we know the more secure blockchains. So in the interim people have to be cautiuos.
